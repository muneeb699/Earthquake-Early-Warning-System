# Earthquake-Early-Warning-System
Earthquake early warning methodologies can be used to provide a few to tens of seconds warning prior to ground shaking in damaging earthquakes. Warning systems are already in use in Japan, Taiwan, Mexico and Turkey, and in this research we have implemented the early warning system that is capable of detecting the waves through sensor and send those signals wirelessly on a device that is serially connected to a computer. The final output is shown on a LABVIEW application which flags the user when threshold is crossed.
